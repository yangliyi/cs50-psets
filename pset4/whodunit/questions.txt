1.  A header file declares sets of integer types having specified widths, and shall define corresponding sets of macros
2.  For different sizes of values, we would need to use different type to store, i.g. uint8_t for smaller values, uint16_t for larger values.
3.  1 byte in a BYTE, 4 bytes in a DWORD, 4 bytes in a LONG, 2 bytes in a WORD
4.  The first 2 bytes of the BMP file format are the character "B" then the character "M" in ASCII encoding
5.  bfSize is the size of the whole bmp file. biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER header file.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  The file doesn't exist; the file is opened in a mode that doesn't allow other accesses; the file exists, but you don't have permissions.
9.  Because we only read one element at a time.
10. 3
11. Sets file position.
12. When calling fseek(), we could give SEEK_CUR as the last argument. In that case, it would change from its current location.
